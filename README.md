# File-Encryptor
A simple python .txt file encryptor and decryptor

Steps: Run encryptor.py, choose the .txt file to encrypt, here for testing I have added a sample txt file called data.txt. Next set a password

To decrypt, Run decryptor.py, choose the txt file, enter your password and there you have it!
